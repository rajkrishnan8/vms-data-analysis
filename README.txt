Getting Started

Create a folder named 'files' under the applications root folder. Create a folder named 'sample' under the files folder. Place the pdf of informatica messages to Pega from Splunk in the 'sample' folder named as 'main.pdf'. Apologies for the crude code and the hardcoding. The next version will be better :)
